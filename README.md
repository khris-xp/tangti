## Building a sample

Build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with [the .NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). Then run
these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample:

```console
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Dev Mode

In development process we could use `dotnet watch`.
The dotnet watch command is a file watcher. When it detects a change, it runs the dotnet run command or a specified dotnet command.

```console
dotnet watch
